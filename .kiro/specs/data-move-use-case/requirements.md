# DataMove Use Case Requirements

## Introduction

The DataMove use case is a new feature for the vector-dataloader library that provides a robust, production-grade solution for moving data from CSV files (local or S3) to PostgreSQL databases. Unlike the existing embedding-focused use cases, DataMove is designed specifically for plain data migration scenarios where the primary goal is to reliably transfer data from one location to another while handling various data types including vector columns.

This use case addresses the need for a dedicated data migration tool that can handle complex validation scenarios, schema compatibility checks, and production-grade error handling without the overhead of embedding generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Data Movement Functionality

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to move data from CSV files to PostgreSQL tables, so that I can migrate data reliably without embedding generation overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CSV file path is provided THEN the system SHALL load the CSV data into memory
2. WHEN the destination table name is specified THEN the system SHALL target that specific PostgreSQL table
3. WHEN data movement is initiated THEN the system SHALL preserve all original data types from the CSV
4. WHEN vector-type columns are present THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly without modification
5. WHEN the operation completes successfully THEN all CSV data SHALL be present in the target table

### Requirement 2: Table Existence Handling

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the system to handle both existing and non-existing tables, so that I can use the same tool for different migration scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the target table does not exist THEN the system SHALL create a new table using CSV schema
2. WHEN creating a new table THEN the system SHALL preserve all column names and data types from CSV
3. WHEN the target table exists THEN the system SHALL require a move_type parameter
4. WHEN move_type is not provided for existing tables THEN the system SHALL raise a validation error
5. WHEN table creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 3: Existing Schema Validation (move_type="existing_schema")

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want strict schema validation when updating existing tables, so that I can ensure data integrity and prevent schema conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN move_type is "existing_schema" THEN the system SHALL perform exact column name matching
2. WHEN column names don't match exactly THEN the system SHALL raise a validation error
3. WHEN column types don't match THEN the system SHALL raise a validation error with specific details
4. WHEN nullable constraints differ THEN the system SHALL validate and report mismatches
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL replace all existing table data with CSV data
6. WHEN CSV has missing columns THEN the system SHALL raise a validation error
7. WHEN CSV has extra columns THEN the system SHALL raise a validation error

### Requirement 4: New Schema Flexibility (move_type="new_schema")

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want flexible schema handling for evolving data structures, so that I can accommodate schema changes while preventing case-sensitive conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN move_type is "new_schema" THEN the system SHALL allow column additions and removals
2. WHEN column names have case differences THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent conflicts
3. WHEN "item" exists in DB and "Item" exists in CSV THEN the system SHALL raise a case-sensitivity error
4. WHEN new columns are added THEN the system SHALL accept them without validation errors
5. WHEN columns are removed THEN the system SHALL accept the change without validation errors
6. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL update the table schema and data accordingly

### Requirement 5: Production-Grade Error Handling

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific file access error details
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide connection-specific error information
3. WHEN data type conversion fails THEN the system SHALL identify the problematic column and value
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with context
5. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes to maintain consistency
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 6: Data Type Support and Conversion

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want support for all PostgreSQL data types including vectors, so that I can migrate complex data structures without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSV contains text data THEN the system SHALL map to PostgreSQL text type
2. WHEN CSV contains numeric data THEN the system SHALL map to appropriate PostgreSQL numeric types
3. WHEN CSV contains date/time data THEN the system SHALL handle PostgreSQL timestamp types
4. WHEN CSV contains boolean data THEN the system SHALL map to PostgreSQL boolean type
5. WHEN CSV contains JSON/array data THEN the system SHALL map to PostgreSQL jsonb type
6. WHEN CSV contains vector data THEN the system SHALL preserve vector format and dimensions
7. WHEN type conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific conversion error details

### Requirement 7: PostgreSQL-Specific Implementation

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want PostgreSQL-optimized data movement, so that I can leverage PostgreSQL-specific features and performance optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing DataMove THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-specific repository only
2. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL bulk insert capabilities
3. WHEN handling transactions THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL transaction management
4. WHEN creating indexes THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL-appropriate index types
5. WHEN the feature is stable THEN it MAY be extended to other database providers

### Requirement 8: Interface and Architecture Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DataMove use case to follow existing project patterns, so that it integrates seamlessly with the current codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing DataMove THEN the system SHALL follow existing use case patterns
2. WHEN creating interfaces THEN the system SHALL extend existing repository interfaces appropriately
3. WHEN handling storage THEN the system SHALL use existing storage loader interfaces
4. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow existing project structure and naming conventions
5. WHEN adding new methods THEN the system SHALL maintain existing interface compatibility

### Requirement 9: Validation and Analysis Reporting

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want detailed validation reports, so that I can understand exactly what will change before data movement occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed comparison report
2. WHEN schema differences exist THEN the system SHALL list all column differences with types
3. WHEN data conflicts are found THEN the system SHALL report specific rows and columns affected
4. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of changes to be made
5. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide dry-run capability without actual data movement

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want efficient data movement for large datasets, so that I can handle production-scale data migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large CSV files THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient streaming where possible
2. WHEN inserting data THEN the system SHALL use batch operations for optimal performance
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL not compromise performance for error checking
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide timing and performance metrics
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate memory management strategies
