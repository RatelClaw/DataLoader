# EmbLoader: Embedding Loader Package

**EmbLoader** is a robust, extensible Python library for loading CSV data from S3 or local files into vector stores (**Postgres, FAISS, Chroma**) with embedding generation.  
It supports multiple embedding providers (**Bedrock, Gemini, Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI**) and two embedding modes:

- **Combined**: Concatenated text with a single embedding.
- **Separated**: Individual embeddings per column.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Loading**: From S3 or local CSV files.
- **Embedding Generation**: Combined or separated modes.
- **Embedding Providers**: AWS Bedrock, Google Gemini, Sentence-Transformers (local), OpenAI.
- **Vector Stores**: Postgres (with pgvector), FAISS (in-memory), Chroma (persistent).
- **Update Support**: Detects new/updated/removed rows, handles soft deletes.
- **Scalability**: Batch operations, retries, connection pooling.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-style for providers and stores.
- **Validation**: Schema, type, null checks.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install embdloader
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Local Postgres / AWS / Env Vars

EmbLoader uses **environment variables** for configuration. For convenience, store them in a `.env` file at the **project root** (same level as `setup.py` and `README.md`).

### Example `.env`

```env
# Google Gemini API Key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Local Postgres DB config
LOCAL_POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
LOCAL_POSTGRES_PORT=5432
LOCAL_POSTGRES_DB=DBname
LOCAL_POSTGRES_USER=postgres
LOCAL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

# Optional AWS configs (for Bedrock/S3)
AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
SECRET_NAME=abc

etc

```

### How it works

- The library automatically reads `.env` using [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).
- If `.env` is missing, it falls back to system environment variables.
- For production (AWS), set `use_aws=True` in `DBConnection` to fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager instead of `.env`.
- Embedding providers: Gemini, OpenAI, Bedrock, Sentence-Transformers
- Vector stores: Postgres (with pgvector), FAISS (in-memory), Chroma (persistent)
